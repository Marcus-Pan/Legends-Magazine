Editor's Notes
By Marcus Pan

As you can see, in this issue I managed to get some friends (and lovers) to help out with the making of this magazine. I hope this is not a one-time deal. Thanks to those that helped out, and keep-em coming!

I am still waiting on the promises of a few whom I have expected submissions from since issue 1…Erric, Fwank, Glenn…MOVE YOUR ASS!

Please take note of the new area code on how to reach me.

ENJOY!

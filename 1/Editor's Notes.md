# Editor's Notes
By Marcus Pan

Welcome to the first issue of "Legends." This is a non-profit mini-magazine geared to players of TSR's Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Role Playing Game system. This magazine is produced in limited copies and presented free on a first-come, first-serve basis. A lot of work goes into this magazine, so I hope it is thoroughly enjoyed.

Sincerely,

Marcus Pan

Editor-In-Chief

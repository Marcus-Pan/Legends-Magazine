As stated before, this is a fully non-profit magazine. Publishable materials on the subject of AD&D gaming and/or the medieval period is gratefully accepted. This includes artwork, articles, and stories of both fiction and non-fiction. We also can publish advertisements for gaming sessions, and works of other non-profit authors at no charge. Although I can not guarantee the printing of all transcripts sent, I do however read all submissions thoroughly. I also urge you do not send an only copy of your work, as I can not send it back.

Thank You!

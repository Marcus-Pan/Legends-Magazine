Editor's Notes
By Marcus Pan

Yet another cover art debut by Erric Z. this issue. Nice pick. Gruesomeâ€¦but nice. (grin) Well, I finished this issue quickly after finishing Issue 6, but there is a large backup of work here as far as the copying goes. Our copier, Richard P., is out sick and therefore unable to make the copies until such time as he gets better. I will him the best, and may good health follow closely behind thee.

Some interesting items here this issue, so read on and enjoy them. Again, sorry about the lateness of issue-arrivals due to the copying backlogs.

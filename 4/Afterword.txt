Afterword
By Marcus Pan

I hope you enjoyed this issue of Legends. I enjoyed writing it, and hope you enjoyed reading it just as much.

Don't expect Legends No. 5 to be out for some time, as I am going to slow down on the magazines and actually begin work on some of the other items I write (such as modules, stories, etc…). I also want to work on my gaming milieu, as there is still much to do before it is full and ready.

But don't worry…Legends 5 will get here some day… ;)

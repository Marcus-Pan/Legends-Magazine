Editor's Notes
By Marcus Pan

After releasing Legends Number 3 just this morning, I moved right along and began on Issue No. 4, which you now hold in your hand. I am not yet fully aware of everything you will find in this issue, because much of the magazine's layout is still shrouded in mystery.I do know, however, you will find the first chapter of the "Albinorian Chronicles". These chapters will be found within from time to time, and are simply short stories telling of happenings and adventures in a vast fantasy world which I call Albinor. All these stories were previously played adventures that I ran myself. My players should not be surprised to see familiar adventures. I hope you enjoy this new series, and I also hope you enjoy this issue of Legends. (Which is now typewritten, in case you haven't noticed…)

And lastly, keep those publishable works coming…
Sincerely,
MARCUS PAN

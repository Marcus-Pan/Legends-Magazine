Editor's Notes
By Marcus Pan

Welcome to Issue No. 5 from Legends. Again, I hope you enjoy this issue (hope I'm not beginning to sound monotonous, but the "editor's law" says I MUST say that all the damn time). The magazine is really starting to do well, as far as I can see.

One good thing, is our covers seem to get more and more exotic…I like that. We went from a wimpy sword (Issue 1), to a wimpy castle (Issue 2), to a full spread by Wild Thing (Issue 3). My art on Issue 4 rules…I can say that 'cuz I'm the editor. This issue we debut Mar-ee as cover artist…great pic.

Again, I am STILL waiting on material from Erric the Rabbit, Fwankie, Glenn the Shrink, and more from Wild Thing. I'm beginning to get very impatient…

Well, enjoy the issue.

One last thing, because our copier is a bum (grin), we can only make single-sided copies, so unfortunately the magazine will be on single-sided paper from now on. (What a bum.) Well, at least it'll LOOK bigger…;)

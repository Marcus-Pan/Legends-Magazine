# Editor's Notes
By Marcus Pan

Here, finally, you hold in your hand Legends Magazine Issue Number 2. There are a few things I'd like to say.

First of all, I want to apologize for the late arrival of issue one. While it was supposed to be out in mid-October, it never hit the streets until two months later. This delay was the fault of our copier, and I apologize.

Also, I do not enjoy being the only person involved in the publishing of this magazine. In case you haven't noticed, Legends issue one was created in its entirety by myself. This endeavor was not meant to be a solo act. Any articles, art, series, etc. that you think I could use, send to me. The ones who originally offered their assistance have yet to do so.

And my final note is this:
**Merry Christmas!**
**Happy Chanukah!**
**Happy New Year!**

Enjoy your holiday seasonâ€¦
Sincerely,
Marcus Pan
Editor-In-Chief

Afterword
By Marcus Pan

You will notice that a few of the articles mentioned have not appeared in this issue. "Flight of Icarus," said to appear here from issue 1, will not be published. And the game playing aid "Tough, not Terminal" will appear in issue 3. Next issue will deal more with game-playing. I hope you enjoyed this issue, and Happy Holidays!

Sincerely,
Marcus Pan
